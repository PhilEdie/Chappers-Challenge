# Chapper's Challenge

For my final Software Design project, I worked in a team of five people to implement a java clone of Epyx’s 1989 game ‘Chips Challenge’. 

Each member was responsible for one module each. I was responsible for the 'Persistence' module. I implemented the save and load feature using XML parsing. I also implemented a plugin system which allows for any external Java classes to be loaded in as enemies in the game. 

## What I learned:
- I developed a better understanding of using Git within a team environment.
- I understand the importance of following a modular design.   
- I learned how XML files were structured and how DOM parsing works.
- I learned how to use the JDOM2 and the URLClassLoader libraries.
